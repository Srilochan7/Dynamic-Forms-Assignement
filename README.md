## ü§ñ AI Service Documentation

During development, AI tools were used extensively to speed up frontend development by generating cleaner UI code and smoother animations. This helped maintain a high-quality user experience while reducing manual coding overhead.

No AI models or external AI APIs are embedded in the runtime of the application. All PDF generation and data processing are done deterministically on the backend using Puppeteer and Prisma.

## üîç Architecture, Design & Transparency Principles

How did you use AI tools in development?
Used AI mainly to build a cleaner frontend faster‚Äîbetter UI code and smoother animations. Didn‚Äôt put any AI in the product itself, just used it as a dev assistant.

What principles guided your architecture, design, and product transparency logic?
I only built the basic frontend and hosted it on Vercel. The backend and server (API routes, DB, PDF gen) I made myself from scratch for full control. The design focuses on simplicity, type safety, clear separation of frontend/backend, and making sure PDF generation is fully transparent and auditable‚Äîno black-box AI magic anywhere. Security and error handling are straightforward and robust.
